# Turtle-Race-Game
The Turtle Race project is a fun and interactive way to learn Python programming. It
involves creating a race between multiple turtles on a graphical interface using the Turtle
module. Participants can place bets on the turtles, and the program simulates the race,
displaying the winner at the end. This project helps beginners understand concepts like
loops, conditionals, and graphical user interfaces in Python.
Python's Turtle module allows programmers to create graphics and shapes using a turtle
that moves around the screen. In this project, we utilize the Turtle module to create a race
track and multiple turtles that race against each other. Users can interact with the program
by placing bets on the turtles and watching the race unfold.

The final objective is to make a fully featured and functional turtle game. So we plan to
start with small simple steps.
We have decided to make the project using loops to draw a racetrack and create a racing
turtle game.
